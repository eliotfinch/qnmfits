# qnmfits
Least-squares fitting of quasinormal modes to ringdown waveforms. Note that this code differs slightly from the version on PyPI and Conda, which use the code [here](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/qnmfits) (I will refer to this as the SXS code). The SXS code leverages [`scri`](https://github.com/moble/scri) and the `WaveformModes` data type which makes it quite straightforward to perform fits to CCE waveforms in the superrest frame (see the README of the SXS code for an example). This does not require `scri`, and assumes you have an array of data you want to fit to (this makes it easy to fit to generic waveforms). Currently implemented in this code but not in the SXS code are nonlinear QNMs (that is, QNMs whose complex frequency consists of a linear combination of leading-order QNMs), and functions to perform spatial mapping of QNMs (see Usage below).

## Installation

The package can be installed with `pip install .` - this assumes you are in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file. All dependencies for SXS waveform analysis should be installed automatically. Currently, the [`gwsurrogate`](https://pypi.org/project/gwsurrogate/) and [`surfinBH`](https://pypi.org/project/surfinBH/) packages (needed for the analysis of surrogate models) are not automatically installed.

Note that when first importing the package, there may be a short delay.

You may prefer to install the dependencies via `conda` - please see the dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file. All packages are available on `conda` or `conda-forge`. You may additionally need to install `spinsfast` via

```bash
conda install --channel conda-forge spinsfast
```

If using `conda`, I recommend installing all dependencies via `conda` first, and then running `pip install .` in the cloned `qnmfits` directory.

## Usage

The core of the package is the [`qnmfits.py`](qnmfits/qnmfits.py) file; this contains a collection of functions for performing ringdown analyses on any supplied waveform. For an overview of the available functions, see the [package tutorial notebook](examples/package_tutorial.ipynb).

Additional functions for performing spatial mapping of linear and quadratic QNMs are available in [`spatial_mapping_functions.py`](qnmfits/spatial_mapping_functions.py). See [this repository](https://github.com/Richardvnd/spatial_mapping) for example usage. See also Dyer & Moore ([arxiv:2410.13935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13935)) for further details.

Often you will want to work with SXS waveforms. For this we provide a [`SXS` helper class](qnmfits/Waveforms/Simulation.py#L12) (also demonstrated in the package tutorial) to load and manipulate waveforms (see the functions in [`Base.py`](qnmfits/Waveforms/Base.py) to see what manipulations are available). You can, of course, load the SXS waveform data by other means and then pass it to the functions in `qnmfits.py`. Similar to the `SXS` class, there are classes for loading [NRSur7dq4](qnmfits/Waveforms/Surrogate.py#L7) and [NRHybSur3dq8](qnmfits/Waveforms/Surrogate.py#L201) surrogate waveforms (note that these are less well-tested).

## A note on QNM labelling

In this package QNMs are specified with four numbers: `(ell, m, n, sign)`. The first three numbers refer to the usual angular (`ell`), azimuthal (`m`), and overtone (`n`) indices. The fourth number is either `+1` or `-1`, and refers to the sign of the real part of the QNM frequency. In other words, `sign=1` refers to the "regular" QNMs to the right of the imaginary axis, and `sign=-1` refers to "mirror" QNMs to the left of the imaginary axis. Note that this is different to the prograde (co-rotating) and retrograde (counter-rotating) classification you sometimes see. See the figure below ([source code here](examples/qnm_taxonomy.ipynb)) for a visualisation of the different QNM labelling conventions:

![QNM taxonomy](examples/qnm_taxonomy.png)

If you want use QNMs with an overtone index `n>7`, then you will need to download extra data by calling the `download_cook_data()` function:

```python
import qnmfits
qnmfits.download_cook_data()
```

 The reason for this is because for `n>7` we encounter QNM "multiplets" which the `qnm` package has trouble handling. Note that there are different labelling conventions for these multiplets. For example, the Schwarzschild (2,2,8) QNM has the behaviour of "splitting" into two branches when the spin is increased:

![QNM multiplet taxonomy](examples/qnm_multiplet_taxonomy.png)

This has led to these two branches being labelled as (2,2,8<sub>0</sub>) and (2,2,8<sub>1</sub>) by Cook & Zalutskiy ([arxiv:1607.07406](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07406)). However, from a practical perspective we will be mostly working with Kerr black holes, and these two branches behave as a `n=8` and `n=9` overtone. So, as indicated by the figure above, we label them as such (this follows the convention of Forteza & Mourier ([arXiv:2107.11829](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11829))).
