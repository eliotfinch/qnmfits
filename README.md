# qnmfits
Least-squares fitting of quasinormal modes to ringdown waveforms.

## Installation

The package can be installed with `pip install .` - this assumes you are in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file. All dependencies for SXS waveform analysis should be installed automatically. Currently, the [`gwsurrogate`](https://pypi.org/project/gwsurrogate/) and [`surfinBH`](https://pypi.org/project/surfinBH/) packages (needed for the analysis of surrogate models) are not automatically installed.

Note that when first importing the package, there may be a short delay.
